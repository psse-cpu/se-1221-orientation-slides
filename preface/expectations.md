# Expectations (1/2)

- Even if online:
  * <twemoji-face-with-monocle /> attend class hours from 2 to 5pm, and stay **focused**
  * <twemoji-technologist /> work on tasks for group projects
- Everyone contributes:
  * <logos-visual-studio-code /> code: _since it's also your project for SE-1222 and SE-1223_
  * if coding is not your forte, in my class (**_only_**) - you can also contribute _"other SE career paths stuff"_, e.g.:
    - <twemoji-test-tube /> [tests - _mostly automated E2E/UI tests, maybe a little manual_][1]
    - <logos-trello /> [requirements - validation, UX][2]
  * what does not count as a contribution:
    - <twemoji-camera /> **only** contributing graphics, sprites (`BSSE !== DMIA`, also plenty of assets online)
    - <logos-google-icon /> _"research"_ - <small>in my experience, this usually means NOTHING</small>

# Expectations (2/2)

- <twemoji-calendar /> don't cram: **DO some basic** project management
- <mdi-account-group class="text-blue-500" /> work as a **group** of 5-6 people, no carries
- <twemoji-brain /> **MASTER** your data structures _(SE-1222)_ and OOP _(SE-1223)_
- <twemoji-sos-button /> **Ask for help** from senior students or teachers
  * your knowledge is too lacking for a presentable product _(though sometimes there are exceptions)_

## Not expected

- <twemoji-high-voltage /> becoming expert Web app or game developer over a few months
  + Web app development (SE-2125) is next semester
  + Game development is an elective, and may not even be offered
  + Okay to be unable to _"defend"_ Web-related or game-related code that are way to advanced for rookie learners
- <twemoji-speaking-head /> <u>`0` hours lecture:</u> we'll have crash courses, but most of our 3-hour session is for WORK
