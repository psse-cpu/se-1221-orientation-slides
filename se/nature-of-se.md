# Nature of SE

- complex
- intangible
  * not governed by natural sciences like physics, chemistry, etc.
  * computer science as the foundation
  * hard to understand development effort
- labor-intensive
  * the bulk of the costs is the salary of the software development team
  * in other engineering disciplines - material and manufacturing takes up a huge %
  * hard to automate _(still true as of 2023)_
- Quality of software engineers vary
- Perceived ease of modification
  * changes usually introduce unforeseen defects _(a.k.a. <twemoji-lady-beetle /> bugs)_
