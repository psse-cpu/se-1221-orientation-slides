# DESIGN: in the _software design KA of the SWEBOK_

- is the software engineering life cycle activity in which **software requirements** are analyzed in order to 
- produce a **<u>description of the softwareâ€™s internal structure</u>** that will serve as the _**basis for 
  its construction**_.
  + architecture: _"high-level design"_ (SE 2223: Software Architecture)
  + detailed design: _"low-level design"_ (incorporated across different courses), e.g.:
    * OOP design principles will be dicussed in SE-1223 _(Software Development II)_
    * Design patterns will be discussed in SE-2122 _(Software Component Design)_
- Many ways to write code for the same problem:
  + _"well-designed"_ code allow us to navigate complexity
  + it allow us to introduce changes without breaking something else
- Your code **always has a _design_** (it always has an _internal structure_) whether it's documented or not.
  + Design is not always _"sketching diagrams"_ akin to blueprints
  + There's a [design technique called test-driven development (TDD)][2] that does this -- no diagrams!
  + Designs can be as simple as a rough sketch on a whiteboard that is [finished in code][1]
