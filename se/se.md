# Software engineer

- when used to denote a profession: is much more broadly employed than “software engineering” as an 
  academic discipline or a degree program. 
- There are many **more individuals** with a job title or professional identity of a “software engineer” 
  * than those who have graduated from BSSE programs. 
- More confusion: software engineering is a course/subject in BSCS and sometimes, BSIT or BSCpE programs

As much as I want to promote the department that molded me, but [1 Peter 3:10][2] teaches us to speak honestly:
> ### <twemoji-person-gesturing-no /> You DON'T need to be a BSSE graduate to become a _"software engineer"_!

> #### <twemoji-warning /> You may not end up with a job title of _"software engineer"_ (or equivalent) even with a BSSE degree, esp. in less _"technical"_ roles

- but maybe: _business analyst, "QA Engineer" <small>(popular but inaccurate)</small>, Test Engineer, ScrumMaster_, etc.

# Software engineering

- would usually refer to the discipline
  * body of knowledge ([SWEBOK][1]): 15 knowledge areas
  * SE focuses on creating software-based solutions, but it is **much more than programming.** 
- SE emphasizes the use:
  * of appropriate software development practices,
  * the integration of engineering rigor, along with 
  * the ability to apply advanced algorithms and data structures developed in computer science. 
- strongly focused on designing software systems that are:
  * high-quality
  * meets or exceeds customer expectations
  * manages complexity and change

# Software Engineering

- Boring but still accurate definition:

> ##### is the application of a systematic, disciplined, quantifiable approach to the design, development, operation, and maintenance of software, and the study of these approaches; that is, the application of engineering to software.

- Simple, modern, and fresh:

> ## Programming over time.

- There's a lot to unpack from those three words.
  + **Time** introduces two of SE's mortal enemies:
    * complexity
    * change
  + Software engineers program!  They **write code**!
    * civil eng'g: [not always a good analogy to SE][1]
    * e.g. CE does design, and blue-collars do <twemoji-hammer /><twemoji-carpentry-saw />
