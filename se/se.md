# Software engineer

- when used to denote a profession: is much more broadly employed than “software engineering” as an 
  academic discipline or a degree program. 
- There are many **more individuals** with a job title or professional identity of a “software engineer” 
  * than those who have graduated from BSSE programs. 
- More confusion: software engineering is a course/subject in BSCS and sometimes, BSIT or BSCpE programs
- See [this document by ACM][1], on page 28

> ### <twemoji-person-gesturing-no /> You DON'T need to be a BSSE graduate to become a _"software engineer"_!

> #### <twemoji-warning /> You may not end up with a job title of _"software engineer"_ (or equivalent) even with a BSSE degree

perhaps: _business analyst, "QA Engineer" <small>(inaccurate)</small>, Test Engineer_

  * 15 knowledge areas
  * Even though SE focuses on creating software-based solutions, it is **much more than programming.** 
- SE emphasizes the use:
  * of appropriate software development practices
  * the integration of engineering rigor with 
  * the ability to apply advanced algorithms and data structures developed in computer science. 
- strongly focused on designing software systems that are:
  * reliable
  * trustworthy
  * secure
  * usable
